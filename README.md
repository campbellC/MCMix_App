# MCMix

MCMix is an anonymous communications protocol first described in the paper "MCMix: Anonymous Messages via Secure Multiparty Computation" by Alexopoulos, Kiayias, Talviste and Zacharias. It is designed to allow scalable communications whilst providing
perfect privacy in the presence of a global adversary - i.e. no matter how powerful the surveillance so long as a majority of the servers are honest and the device's of you and your conversation partner are not corrrupted then no one will ever know you were speaking to each other. This repository is the client application of the system - an Android messaging app.

The development of this application was generously funded by Horizon 2020 PANORAMIX project (Grant Agreement No. 653497).
